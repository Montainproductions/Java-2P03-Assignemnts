# Java 2P03 Assignemnts
 This is work for all of my assignments in the COSC 2P03 Advance Data Structure class at Brock University.
 
 ## Assignment 1
 For this assignment I was required to make a wait queue for a clinic and had to use a Linked list to create the queue and as time in the day passed (Callculated through a monitor that calculated the time of day) it would either insert a new patient or eliminate the first person in the queue.
 
 The main errors I could of improved on was in the process of adding the eliminate first person in queue I had started to move some code that was initially setting up the Queue which meant that it caused a problem were the last person in the txt file was appearing repeatedly in the linked list. Because I was working on it very close to the dead line I didnt have time to notice and fix the problem.
