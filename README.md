# Java 2P03 Assignemnts
 This is work for all of my assignments in the COSC 2P03 Advance Data Structure class at Brock University.
 
 ## Assignment 1
 For this assignment I was required to make a wait queue for a clinic and had to use a Linked list to create the queue and as time in the day passed (Callculated through a monitor that calculated the time of day) it would either insert a new patient or eliminate the first person in the queue.
 
 The main errors I could of improved on was in the process of adding the eliminate first person in queue I had started to move some code that was initially setting up the Queue which meant that it caused a problem were the last person in the txt file was appearing repeatedly in the linked list. Because I was working on it very close to the dead line I didnt have time to notice and fix the problem. 
 Meanwhile since I was able to work on linkedlist last year for a diffrent class it wasnt as hard to wrap my head around it and get the base linked list working for the rest of the assignment
 
 Final Grade - 5.75/8 - 71.88%
 
 ## Assignment 2
 
 
 Final grade - 11.25/12 - 93.75%
 
 ## Assignment 3
 
 For this assignment I was required to build a heap data structure as a way to store a set of drug infromation. After that I was meant to implement a trickle down system that would go through the heap and update the position of any drug I needed (Usually the first object in the Heap array).
 
 The most difficult part of the assignment was setting up the Heap arrays and knowing if the Heap I was outputing was orderd correctly or I was doing it incorrectly. At the same time the Heap Arrays seem to be a slightly more complicated and convoluted binary tree data structure (With less loss nodes compared to the Binary tree).
 
 ## Assignment 4
